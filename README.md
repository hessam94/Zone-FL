# Zone-FL
This project implements ZFL, a zone-based [Federated Learning](https://federated.withgoogle.com/) architecture that builds and manages different models for different geographical zones to mitigate the problem of non-IID data. The main idea of ZFL is to adapt each zone model to the data and behaviors of the users who frequently spend time in that zone. ZFL is designed to work in a mobile-edge-cloud infrastructure, where FL training in each zone is managed by an edge node. The cloud plays a coordinator role to support zone management, load-balancing, and fault tolerance across edge nodes. We implemented and evaluated two proof-of-concept models based on ZFL for two different types of ML problems, a vehicular traffic prediction model and a mobile user activity recommendation model.

These projects have been implemented offline and we don't have different client-server machines here. This means we run the programs for each group of data(location Zones) separately and then compare it with traditional FL. The results show the zone based models built with ZFL lead to higher accuracy compared to global FL models. 

ZoneFL had some advantage compare to central FL. Current FL solutions, do not address well the requirements for good model accuracy and adaptability to user mobility behavior. FL training for large numbers of mobile users spread over large areas suffers from lower accuracy due to the non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data distribution, specific to mobile users whose behaviors are location dependent. The main idea of ZFL is to divide the space into a number of
zones with similar user behaviors and train FL models for each of these zones. As users move from one zone to another, their mobile devices also switch from one zone model to another. In this way, ZFL adapts each zone model to the data and behaviors of the users who frequently spend time in that zone. Many mobile apps can benefit from ZFL models trained on mobile sensing data.
